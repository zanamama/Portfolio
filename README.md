# Portfolio

## My Task

Welcome to my 2nd week's homework assignment! I'm going to be creating a web application from scratch! I will be adding code as I progress along in the course in order to fine-tune a great portfolio that I can use for employement in the near future.

I will be applying the core skills I know so far: flexbox, media queries, and CSS variables. This will be used and useful during my job search this fall.

AS AN employer
I WANT to view a seamless site that is engaging and easy to follow, with projects included,
SO THAT I can review samples of the work displayed, in considering Zana for employement as a Junior React JS Developer.

## Acceptance Criteria (copied)

GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work
WHEN I load their portfolio
THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them
WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
WHEN I click on the images of the applications
THEN I am taken to that deployed application
WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport

The following animation will show the website's appearance and functionality.
